# Mouse sensitivity
An AHK (AutoHotKey) script that sets the mouse sensitivity setting.

I've found that Windows resets the sensitivity of my mouse or trackpad every time i start my computer. This script sets the sensitivity to my liking 14 out of 20.

Change *SetMouseSpeed* to your preferred sensitivity.

This script definitely works for Windows 10. I'm not sure if it will work for other another OS.


To get this script to work each and every time you start your computer, place the executable in *'..\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp'*. Open run using *Win+R* and open *'shell:common startup'*.
